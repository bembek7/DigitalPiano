<h1>Digital Piano Project</h1>

The Digital Piano Project is a simple Qt-based application designed to simulate a digital piano, allowing users to play musical notes, adjust pitch, control volume, and customize key bindings. The technology used was Qt 6.5.2 with the Qt Multimedia library.

<h2>Code Structure</h2>

The project's code is organized into several classes, including:

-SoundsManager: Responsible for managing the playback of musical notes and handling pitch, volume, and key bindings.

-MainWindow: The main application window, which includes the user interface for interacting with the digital piano.

-KeyReceiver: An event filter class used for binding custom keys to musical notes.
